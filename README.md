#workout app: 
this android app is designed to help you do your workout 
precisely a high intensity interval training (HIIT)
thats why a timer and a list of movement is needed

#new workout:  
the plus sign in the top-right will allow you to create a new list of movement
you enter the name of the workout and the moves you want to do in it
you save when you finish and your new workout will appear on the home page

#start: 
you choose one workout and click start and you will have to execute each move in given time
you can pause if you want 
a pop up message will indicate you which move is next 
at the end the app will redirect you at the home page.
